Slick but packs a punch: the Xbox One S is surely the gaming console to grab. In a new iteration of its famed console, Microsoft introduces Xbox One S with an extremely powerful HDR (High Dynamic Range) upgrade as well as the ability to display in 4k. 

The XBOX One S features an ultra HD Blu-ray device, the ability to display in 4K, provide video streaming in 4k as well as a supporting high dynamic range for new compatible HDR TVs. In order to fully immerse yourself to the treasures of 4K HDR in Xbox ONE S, three things are essential:

### The device

The newest version of the Xbox One S does have the ability to display in 4K HDR. Due to hardware limitations, older versions of Xbox One can only possibly accomodate 1080p SDR (Standard Dynamic Range).

Now available at [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2aHUnQk), Microsoft earlier launched the console with a whopping 2TB version at $399. A $449 [Gears of War 4 Limited](http://amzn.to/2aSgq7I) edition is also available for pre-order as of today. 

### A 4K HDR Compatible Television

As HDR support for most TVs are still limited, your best bet at determining HDR capability of your television is the packaging, manual, or much better, the Internet. Popular HDR TVs include Sony [XBR55X850D](http://amzn.to/2bc52HI), LG [65UH6150](http://amzn.to/2bc4OQP), and Samsung [UN60KU6300](http://amzn.to/2aIUphb). If you plan to maximize your Xbox's gaming/media capabalities, we suggest you also grab one of these TVs.

If your TV can support 4K HDR (3840x2160 at 60 Hz) but you weren't able to display the resolution or play video from your Xbox One S, you can troubleshoot the issue on Microsoft's website. 

### HDR Content
Not so fast. Just because you have an HDR compatible TV and a brand-new Xbox One S doesn't mean all videos will magically transform to vivid and accurate 4K HDR wonderâ€”you'd still need compatible content. A good example is Netflix and [Amazon Video](http://www.amazon.com/gp/video/primesignup?tag=).

Just a few select titles were shot in 4K HDR for Netflix/Amazon and it's crucial to check Some Netflix streaming plans also don't have the ability to access these 4K HDR titles. Earlier Blu rays may not display in 4K HDR either.

### Takeaway
As we have written in another [article](http://www.myhdrtv.com/blog/2016/08/09/HDR-and-war.html), 4K HDR is still filled with controversial disputes between manufacturers and content creators. Xbox One S could only disrupt and intensify these controversies as manufacturers and content creators fight each other for market shares from the gamers. It is precisely these controversies that make HDR a more exciting piece of innovation.
