Just as consumers thought that TV technology had reached its peak, manufacturers find more space to squeeze new innovations. With companies rapidly churning out buzzwords like [4K](http://amzn.to/2b0bAZC), [OLED](http://amzn.to/2b75rJr), and Ultra HD, high-resolution viewership has been on a staggering increase. Now a new technology seems to be the new talk of the town: High Dynamic Range Televisions.


## HDR, what?	


**HDR** is is, arguably, the latest thing to happen in television history. While the term is relatively familiar in the field of photography, it has been slowly starting to get popular in the lingo of TVphiles. For years now, a lot of talk has been going round and about concerning this technology and many have been awaiting its unveiling which is already happening. HDR means High Dynamic Range and is capable of utterly influencing viewers experience in gaming and television.

What makes **HDR** so special is that it emphasizes the range of contrast and different colours. With HDR Television or any device compatible with it, you can view content in a richer range of colours. Shallow contrasts will be emphasized to incorporate every detail, whites can be brighter and sparkle with life and darks have more depths to them. HDR viewing is all about detailed brilliance. It simply brings to your view everything that your eye should see but that the limitations of previous technologies have denied you.

While lighting has always affected how much details can be captured as content and to what depths, **HDR** makes it possible to create a surreal or real world. With *Wide Colour Gamut* (WCG), HDR reveals more colours that TVs have not been able to depict. The faintest differences in colur shades are revealed and the different patches of colour that create more details on a feature are also revealed. In a more common language, HDR television and compatible devices will show you the fifty shades of gray in their fifty shades.

## How does it work?

Unfortunately, before there was any general consensus on the definitions, applications and limitations of HDRTVs; many people have blown the whistle about it. However, while contrast and colour are the defining themes of HDRTV, a TV has to meet a specific number of nits or black level to be HDR compatible.  Without meeting this standard, there will be disparity in what really constitutes HDR viewing and its dynamic advantages will wash down the drain. In the other sense of colours, until a TV can produce within the P3 colour spectrum, it cannot be regarded as HDR compatible. 

### Caveat emptor

Another important thing to note is that just because you have an HDRTV or a TV that is HDR compatible doesn’t mean you will begin to view all contents in HDR format. That is far from the truth. The ultimate experience offered by HDR viewing is the product of a symbiotic relationship between the content creators and the HDR devices used to view the content. This means if the content was not created with HDR compatible devices, it can’t be seen in HDR even if the device is HDR compatible. As of now, it is a rarity to find contents produced with 4k resolution not to mention, HDR TV. 

This is not a reason to worry though, if anything, content creators are very adaptable and are usually at the forefront of any improved technology, a strong case for this is Amazon that has released contents in HDR format and that is steadily working to increase releases.

Beyond direct TV viewing or online streaming is the option of creating HDR discs. Ultra-HD Blu ray can make this happen once you play on the Ultra HD Blu ray players. HDR viewing is also available on mobile device with Samsung Galaxy Note-7 being the first in the series.

### Does it make a noticeable differenace?

One real question you are probably asking yourself is that does it really make a difference and the succinct answer is yes it does. While you probably won’t feel like you have never watched TV before when comparing 4K or other “Legacy Televisions” to HDR, you are sure to derive better and more satisfying experience from an HDR viewing because it is simply better.

### I'm sold! Which TV do I get?

While most of these TVs have been working before the eventual release of HDR technology for public consumption, these models are high end with HDR compatibility.

Some 4K TVs that support HDR are: Panasonic Viera TX-55CX7802, LG 55EG960V, Philips PUS8601, Hisense 43H7C. It also includes SUHD TV like Samsung KS9500 and OLED TV, for example, LG Signature G6. Other brands that support HDR are Vizio, Sony, and TCL.
